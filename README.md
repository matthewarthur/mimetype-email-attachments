# mimetype-email-attachments
extracting attachments from raw mimetype emails with base64-encoded attachments 

only tested with jpg but should work for any base64 attachment

see https://github.com/martysweet/aws-lambda-attachment-extractor/blob/master/lambda_email_extractor.py for a better implementation (that I couldn't get to work)
